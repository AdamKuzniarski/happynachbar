## Summary

Improve code structure by extracting repeated logic into reusable components/functions and cleaning up naming and responsibilities. This makes the codebase easier to read, maintain, and extend without changing behavior.

## Tasks

- Create shared layout components (e.g., AppHeader, HomePageLayout, AuthLayout) and wire them into the App Router route groups

- Introduce a lib/ folder for shared utilities/constants (and move duplicated helpers there)

- Refactor pages/components to use the new layouts/utilities and remove duplication (no behavior changes)

## Acceptance Criteria

The app uses the new shared layouts (HomePageLayout, AuthLayout) and a common AppHeader, with no visual or routing regressions.

Shared utilities are centralized in lib/ and existing duplicated code is removed, while application behavior remains unchanged.
